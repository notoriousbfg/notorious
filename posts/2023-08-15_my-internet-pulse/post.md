My blog is my internet pulse. When I feel motivated I write articles or post updates. When I don't, my pulse slows; the content dries up.

I own my blog. I own the words I write and the small corner of the internet I've carved out. My access to it can't be revoked.

My blog stays with me. I add new functionality when I see opportunities to. It's my longest surviving project (the earliest version dating back to 2015, and this current iteration just over a year ago). It having survived so long has allowed me to make incremental 
updates rather than big sprints; I've been able to offer an improved experience for my readers.

My blog is where my ideas establish themselves; some of which I hope others find useful.
