If quality is a perceptual experience, then love is too. So much of culture rests on love but our own ideas vary so wildly - influenced by many things, including our parents' relationships and our own.

Love can be reduced to high levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. And it can be built up in art and music.

But love is observable. It is usually fairly obvious when two people are in love (and sometimes not) e.g. We observe two lovers having a conversation in a park and judge by their interaction that they are in love.

Love is a form of quality because it precedes intellectual thought, influenced by all of our own biases. But it is also real and true.
