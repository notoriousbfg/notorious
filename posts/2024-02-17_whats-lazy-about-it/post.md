A popular gaming Youtuber called Mr Blueberry begins his "Why Last of Us Part 2 Sucks." video by saying "It can be hard to find an unbiased review". He doesn't say whether he thinks that includes his own but then goes on to give his rather (in my opinion) biased opinion on the game. That's because "our feelings about a story make our perceptions about the quality of writing biased" to quote ["Some Quality Biases"](/some-quality-biases/), an essay I wrote after my last playthrough in 2022.

But nearly four years after its release, Reddit users still post thousands of comments decrying the game's "poor storytelling", "poor execution", "woke politics" and "lazy writing" to its subreddits /TheLastOfUs2 and /thelastofus. It's actually quite hard to find anyone on there with anything positive to say, not even that Reddit is the only place where the discussion is taking place, only where the strength of feeling seems to be so great so long after the game's initial release. There doesn't seem to be a place for anyone who did like the game to talk about it.

First I want to talk about some of the behaviours that seem prevalent in (online) discussions of taste, then I'll look at why I still think part 2 was well written.

One of the most cynical of such behaviours I encounter online usually stems from the question: "How could you \[not\] like X?" as though there's some simple explanation beyond simply liking or not liking something. Those explanations are usually either: (a) the person is some sort of raving lunatic or (b) they're not clever enough to understand why. I find the latter more common but that's in a way part of the egotism I'm describing: there's no debate if the person you're arguing with is mad but besting them intellectually is far more satisfying. Though ironically, it's the quality of the criticism and its justifications that gives us an idea of whether we regard the person's opinion as a good one or not (or whether we think they're intelligent [1]) [2], though I think we can all agree slighting another person's intelligence is probably not a great way to bring them round to your point of view.

It's now so common that's become a bit cliche of modern criticism to call something a "masterpiece". Usually when I see this in reviews it tells me the critic has decided to elevate it to a level higher than any comprehension of its masterfulness. Admittedly that's how I felt after experiencing the game for the first time: a body-shaking orgasm of emotion that I felt no need to articulate. As Pirsig wrote in Zen, "Quality is a direct experience independent of and prior to intellectual abstractions", or in other words it would be hard for me to describe what I liked about playing the game as I played it, but perhaps not if I were to analyse it afterwards. Thinking about creative expression in critical terms and explanations tends to take away some of my enjoyment. Isn't it good enough to simply say, "I enjoyed it" without anything further? [3]

#### What's lazy about the writing?

#### What does good writing look like?

Good writing doesn't need to spell everything out for its audience. There's great power in subtlety and nuance and what's not said, which is especially of The Last of Us, with its picaresque characters who see and do such violent things.

Neil Druckmann isn't a narcissist for wanting to tell his own story; if artworks were crafted by committee with every decision subject to unanimous approval, the result would be boring.

[1] What most affects our perception of someone's intelligence? Is it that they use long, multisyllabic words? I try to write my essays in the most concise way though I've been told I use "fancy words" (unncecessarily). Personally I think of the unusual words as being _more_ concise i.e. you can use one word instead of many.

[2] I sometimes laugh when I read a horribly written comment that criticises the "poor writing".

[2] When I [first wrote about the game](/the-last-of-us-part-ii/) in 2020 I said "We seem to live in an age where everything requires some sort of justification but I’m not going to try to convince you why you need to play this game. It was meaningful to me and you’re reading my blog."
