The changes to our behaviours the Covid pandemic brought about are still apparent and will continue to exist for some time. Some of us still wear masks in public places; sometimes we walk on the road to avoid passing someone on the pavement; if we hear coughing on public transport we might sit somewhere else.

We were all complacent when our governments told us we couldn't go outside or socialise with friends. In every community there were those who would say "I'm not taking any more of this" and then later followed the rules like everyone else. We did this not simply because we were told to but most of us believed it was for the greater good.

The effects of the virus have been immediate and obvious. Some of our friends and relatives were severely ill or sadly died.

Climate change ~~will create~~ is creating a world with less ecological diversity, hotter temperatures, droughts and storms. We're starting to see more risks to our health and displacement.

But a blanket of false optimism seems to drape over the lives of many of those living in the West. When we hear about disastrous things happening in other parts of the world we think "that's happening there and I'm here". I remember when the Covid-19 virus was merely a story on the BBC News homepage and we all said "It won't ever get here. It can't." But suddenly something that had originated in a distant province in China became part of all of our lives.

Sadly I think many of us still see climate change as something happening "over there and not here". I've heard close friends and relatives tell me they think it's an economic conspiracy. Others simply don't want to compromise on their way of life.

"It's all a bit preachy".

Fewer planes in the sky _would_ pollute the atmosphere less. That's a statement of fact, no? An inconvenient truth. Flying isn't essential to our survival is it?

But the effects of climate change aren't on our doorstep yet. Can we attribute any deaths to climate change yet? Someone in the UK will die from heatstroke this Summer but it won't make the news.

The sad thing about all of this is the "that's happening there and I'm here" mentality is kind of true. The people most experiencing the effects right now live in the developing world, probably somewhere near the equator.

It'll be when food prices rise due from droughts that average Joe and Jane over here in the comfortable developed world start to pay attention. And by then it'll all be far too late to do anything about.
