Ever since I read "Zen and the Art of Motorcyle Maintenance" a few years ago I've been thinking about quality on and off. A few weeks ago I started "Lila".

It's so often that conversations like "why Marvel films are _better_ than Star Wars" or "why footballer X is _better_ than footballer Y".

According to Pirsig, quality is a "perceptual experience preceding intellectual thought".
