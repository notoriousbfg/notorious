To be really good at anything means doing it a lot. Sure, there are some shortcuts but no great writer, artist, musician, athlete etc has so far been able to fake hard work and determination. There is simply no replacement for it.

An easy way to spend a lot of time doing something is by necessity: cooking, exercise and writing, to name just a few activities. You may even end up enjoying some of these as you find your skill grows and you surpass others.

There is also no replacement for the overwhelming satisfaction and pride that hard work and determination inevitably leads to. This is an innate, selfish need we all have but one that belongs entirely to us and us alone.

We are all just sailboats on a stream, taking our time.
