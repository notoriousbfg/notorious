The best managers I've worked for so far have had one thing in common: they all shield their teams from wider company bullshit, including but not limited to:

- The criticisms of higher-ups: department heads and CEOs with no understanding of empowerment.
- Bureaucracy, politics, power struggles.
- Feature requests disguised as bugs.
- "Urgent fixes" that aren't really urgent at all.
- Direct messages from people you've never spoken to, hoping to circumvent processes.
- Last minute changes to deliverables.

Not having to worry about any of this _noise_ has freed me up to focus solely on the work I've been given and complete it to a high standard. I'm very grateful to have worked under some wonderful managers, some of whom I call friends.
