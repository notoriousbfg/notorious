Typically when we write about time in a romantic way it's to describe its fleeting nature: Time is finite, irreplaceable and escaping.

Recently I've come to think the opposite. For most of us, the passing of time helps us see things in a different light; It helps us recover from trauma and pain; It helps us save what we want to, forget what we want to; It changes how we perceive our own lives.

More time can be a wonderful elixir for regret, which is simply sadness at the passing of time. Whether we regret something we said, did, or didn't do more time would allow us to correct our mistakes (or so we think).  But to live life with regret is itself regrettable.
