It's my opinion that whenever someone is said to "not understand how the world works" or "not know the world", what's really being said is they haven't experienced pain. My parents' generation (baby boomers) accuse us millenials for being naive about things such as work, financial responsibility and relationships but I think that's an unfair stereotype. We might have experienced different hardships, but rest assured we've had our fair share! The average house price as a multiple of average salary is double what is was in the early eighties (when my folks would have been in their twenties), for example [1].

I think most people who describe themselves as "realists" are just cynics aspiring to something more meaningful. It's so hard to see things "as they are", I'd go as far to say that I don't believe in object truth any more.
