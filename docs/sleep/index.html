				<p>Much to the annoyance of my neighbours (probably) I&rsquo;ve been a chronic sleepwalker since I was a teenager. I have no reason to believe things won&rsquo;t continue to be like this for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>Sometimes I go for weeks without sleepwalking, while other times I find myself in an inescapable hole. Sleep disruption seems to beget more sleep disruption. As much as I yearn for a good night&rsquo;s sleep, each night is as bad as the last. I have terrible headaches that start when I wake up and don&rsquo;t go away until mid afternoon; I&rsquo;m unable to concentrate on my work fully, my Maths study, my relationships etc. If I could take a sick day I&rsquo;d be taking weeks off at a time.</p>

<p>The prevailing response when I talk about my sleep is that there&rsquo;s something <em>else</em> I could be doing that I&rsquo;m not. Name any possible lifestyle alteration, medicine, practice or behaviour and you can bet I&rsquo;ve already tried it [1]. While I&rsquo;m sure those I&rsquo;m speaking to are just trying to be helpful I find this response a little offensive because it carries the implication that there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m <em>not</em> doing or something I should be doing <em>more</em> of.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m a smoker with lung cancer - I look after my body fairly well - but I wish this conversation was a different one. I have a medically-diagnosed disorder that causes me a lot of pain and makes my life measurably harder (and for which there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a known solution). The suggestion that the only possible cause is that I&rsquo;m not looking after myself well enough is of no help.</p>

<p>[1] I have tried absolutely <em>everything</em>. I&rsquo;ve even taken medication prescribed by my doctor, which worked for a time until it made me sleepy during the day. After ~15 years with this I&rsquo;m resigned to the belief that this is just something I have/am.</p>
