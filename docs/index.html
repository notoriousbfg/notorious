                    <p>As a grow a little older views I once held collapse like a stack of cards under the gentle prod of criticism. No longer do I think creativity solely occupies the arts; anyone can be creative no matter what (or even in what) they do. It&rsquo;s only apt that I&rsquo;ll use one example in this post from another domain.</p>

<p>For some time I&rsquo;ve held the view that removing creative variables from a creative problem actually <em>encourages</em> creativity. In programming, the simpler solution to a complex problem is usually the best one. Writing code with fewer abstractions in mind (and writing simple tests) can allow programmers to think more creatively.</p>

<p>When we impose constraints (in other words removing the luxury of choice), we&rsquo;re often required to &ldquo;think outside the box&rdquo;; we frame our thinking around these constraints. A first draft of this post included references to lots of other areas where one might exhibit creativity but I think the axiom needs no clarification: constraint breeds creativity. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>

                    <p>The reason it&rsquo;s so difficult to define the human experience without using examples is because it&rsquo;s so diverse, unpredictable, sporadic, <em>messy</em>. Human life is diverse by definition; When did you ever see two strangers walk past each other in the street wearing exactly the same clothes?</p>

<p>Feel like everything is so&hellip; <em>boring</em> lately? So samey?</p>

<p>The working week is draining. You put your laptop to sleep and swipe through some of the headlines on your phone, praying for just one scrap of positivity. Yes, Boris Johnson&rsquo;s a shit. Aren&rsquo;t they all? You see a post on Facebook by a friend who clearly feels the same. Thirty likes (blimey even a few loves) and five others in the comments agree. One even says how brave your friend is for &ldquo;speaking out&rdquo;.</p>

<p>You switch over to Youtube. Time to kick back. You skip out on your subscriptions for today, going straight to the homepage for something new. You&rsquo;ve watched that Office clip of Jim&rsquo;s pranks on Dwight at least fifteen times so another can&rsquo;t hurt. It&rsquo;s not funny per s√© but it makes you feel &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Netflix notifies you about an interesting new documentary but when you load up the app on your TV you don&rsquo;t see it anywhere. You watch a couple of episodes of Rick &amp; Morty while your dinner cooks.</p>

<p>Later, as you&rsquo;re about to go to bed you decide to check in on Hinge. You don&rsquo;t have notifications switched on to save you from the abject disappointment of never getting notified. But it tells you there isn&rsquo;t anyone new to look at today, even though there wasn&rsquo;t anyone the day before and the day before that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must all be too busy watching that Netflix documentary&rdquo;, you lament.</p>

                    <p>To be really good at anything means doing it a lot. Sure, there are some shortcuts but no great writer, artist, musician, athlete etc has so far been able to fake hard work and determination. There is simply no replacement for it.</p>

<p>An easy way to spend a lot of time doing something is by necessity: cooking, exercise and writing, to name just a few activities. You may even end up enjoying some of these as you find your skill grows and you surpass others.</p>

<p>There is also no replacement for the overwhelming satisfaction and pride that hard work and determination inevitably leads to. This is an innate, selfish need we all have but one that belongs entirely to us and us alone.</p>

<p>We are all just sailboats on a stream, taking our time.</p>

                    <p>Most of us make a variety of assumptions during our working day. If we didn&rsquo;t we&rsquo;d have to assess every problem from every possible angle in a logical way, which I think we&rsquo;d all agree would become very tiresome quickly.</p>

<p>Most of the time we make partial assumptions based on pieces of the whole picture; this includes either information we&rsquo;ve observed first hand or collected by others. Sometimes we even make a priori assumptions based on no first-hand observation at all.</p>

<p>Software Engineers are very good at identifying patterns but I think an unfortunate trap we often fall into is linking disparate ideas, especially in the absence of a complete picture. Often I hear engineers say that because they&rsquo;ve found a bug today, the bug has existed since the feature was created. It&rsquo;s an easy (and quite egotistical) assumption but invariably a flawed one.</p>

<p>How can we know whether an assumption is right if we&rsquo;re acting on incomplete information? All correct assumptions (that we may not discover were right until some time has passed) have a clear, reproducible line of reasoning. While there might be huge gaps in the breadcrumb trail between two seemingly unrelated ideas, bread fragments will always line the path between logical assumptions.</p>

                <div class="posthaven-post-body">
                    <p>Last week I wrote a post called <a href="/code-age-vs-time-to-recall">&ldquo;Code Age vs Time to Recall&rdquo;</a> that briefly graced the front page of Hacker News. I&rsquo;d recommend you read it before this one. Ironically it&rsquo;s one of the few posts I&rsquo;ve written that didn&rsquo;t call for at least one redraft; at the time of writing it&rsquo;s been viewed nearly 4000 times (my most-viewed post by far.) In summary, I spoke about the way old code is often perceived to be bad in development teams because it takes longer to recall. How can we reduce this &ldquo;time to recall&rdquo; by writing code that&rsquo;s easy to remember? And to what extent are we responsible for sharing the context around our decisions with others?</p>

<p>Remembering things plays such an important role in our work as developers: strands of conversations, Slack messages, Trello cards, spec documents. All of these different sources only increase our cognitive load; at some point we&rsquo;re bound to forget something. I think if we&rsquo;re able to parse and condense a complex set of requirements into code form, we owe a courtesy to our colleagues (and future selves) to explain the context to our decisions, to help them understand why we did things a certain way.</p>

<p>While it would be futile to attempt to commit to memory code we didn&rsquo;t interact with very often, we can speed up the process of recall by writing code that&rsquo;s easy to understand. Doing so might involve using certain build tools or linters or ensuring the formatting of our files is correct; as one HN commenter said, &ldquo;Painful now, pleasurable later, hopefully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Where a few years ago I might have scoffed at the idea of a temporary variable, variable names can themselves convey meaning (assuming creating one isn&rsquo;t detrimental to performance) and the same applies to class and function names (language permitting) which serve to structure and expound the code they encapsulate. We often talk about names being too verbose (wordy) but sometimes verbosity is a superpower. Much better is it, in my opinion, to overcommunicate what something does and why it is, than to risk its purpose being unclear in a month or year&rsquo;s time.</p>

<p>Git commit messages are extremely valuable sources of context. An underappreciated feature of Sourcetree is that you can search for past commits by message (and file change.) A well written commit message should both describe what changed and why, for example, &ldquo;Replace duplicate Task markup with CommentList component&rdquo;. If I can understand the context to a decision merely by reading a commit message, my time to recall is significantly reduced. Alternatively there is some context to be found in the date of the commit and the branch name, which might also tie in with a pull request. As an aside, I&rsquo;ve always written my commit messages as imperatives (so they can be read in order as a list of instructions) but I&rsquo;m sure there are other conventions for this.</p>

<p>Some of the comments on last week&rsquo;s HN post spoke of automated testing, which itself serves as a form of &ldquo;functional documentation&rdquo;. Tests are the link between a set of requirements (potentially a non-technical document) and code. Again, if we&rsquo;re able to understand the requirements surrounding code, the time to recall is lessened. In many ways, tests also provide a kind of &ldquo;entrenchment&rdquo; in that they prevent unnecessary changes being made later on. If a test fails as a result of a refactor, the code no longer meets the requirement.</p>

<p>Not only do we often make decisions in code as individuals, but often we make decisions with other developers in pull requests. Not only is the clarity of what you say important to the developer making the changes but the more information you can supply (references to files by name, line numbers etc), the more easily you or one of your colleagues will find what they need at some point in the distant future. I&rsquo;d go as far to say that you should write your PR comments with the assumption that they&rsquo;ll be read again by someone else at a later time.</p>

<p>Whether formally acknowledged or not, I think all developers are responsible to some extent for reducing the &ldquo;time to recall&rdquo; the context surrounding our code. We owe it to ourselves and our colleagues to share as much of this context as possible, in code, in commit messages, in tests and in pull requests so that old code can be understood just as well as the new.</p>
