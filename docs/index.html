                    <p>When my girlfriend and I go on walks in the New Forest we regularly talk about the sense of presence we have.</p>

<p>We note the colour of flowers and the different types of tree. We comment on the smell of sap. We see birds dart across our path and listen for each of their distinct calls. We keep our eyes peeled for deer, taking care not to step on any dry twigs, the crack of which would resonate through the forest.</p>

<p>I feel the warmth of her hand in mine.</p>

<p>When I am present I&rsquo;m most receptive to the world immediately around me. While I find it possible to be present in my own thoughts I think I am most present when feel part of the environment I&rsquo;m in, like a character within a scene in a play.</p>

<p>Being present requires focus; It is almost meditative but not tranquil; Instead of clearing my mind I open it to everything. Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to speak at the same time.</p>

<p>The thoughts I have in this state of mind are likely to be only temporary but since I&rsquo;m observing everything, there&rsquo;s no need to remember specific events. Some of this I&rsquo;ll remember and some of it I&rsquo;ll forget.</p>

<p>I find it impossible to be present under the influence of any substance like alcohol, or even a stimulant like caffeine. To be present I must experience the surrounding environment in my truest form.</p>

<p>My presence is not limited to sight. It is enhanced by touch.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I&rsquo;m alone in the forest I close my eyes and listen.</p>

<p>If my sense of presence is perceptual then it cannot be measured, but I suspect that it is noticeable to those around me. However it&rsquo;s a state of mind only I feel and understand.</p>

<p>The benefits I have found to being more present include: remembering things more clearly; stronger relationships with those around me; no longer a desire to be elsewhere or thinking about the next thing; noticing things I wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise noticed.</p>

                    <p>It&rsquo;s so often that topics like &ldquo;why film X is better than film Y&rdquo; come up in conversations with friends. &ldquo;Better&rdquo; is an assessment of quality, something I&rsquo;ve been thinking about ever since reading Robert Pirsig&rsquo;s &ldquo;Zen and the Art of Motorcyle Maintenance&rdquo; a few years ago.</p>

<p>According to Pirsig, quality is a &ldquo;perceptual experience preceding intellectual thought&rdquo;. If one&rsquo;s to believe this, there can be no universal measure for quality; It must be an internal matter.</p>

<p>We often don&rsquo;t consider our own personal biases when deciding whether something&rsquo;s good or not (good meaning &ldquo;high in quality&rdquo;), but in this post I&rsquo;ll describe some common ones I&rsquo;ve encountered.</p>

<h3>Complexity</h3>

<p>When something has been created in a complex way we often assume it&rsquo;s because a great deal of thought has gone into its creation. This is especially true in programming where complex code can appear quite impressive. However it&rsquo;s usually the simplest code that is the highest quality; that has been refactored.</p>

<h3>Content</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s perfectly possible to dislike the themes discussed in a novel but still consider it to be well written. Conversely, it&rsquo;s possible to like the content and think the writing poor. However this is usually not the case: more often we think of things we like as being well executed and things we don&rsquo;t like as being bad. The same can be said of most arts.</p>

<h3>Popularity</h3>

<p>To see that other people liked or disliked something usually influences how we feel about it. In &ldquo;How Art Can Be Good&rdquo;, Paul Graham says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And yet the Mona Lisa is a small, dark painting. If you found
people who&rsquo;d never seen an image of it and sent them to a museum
in which it was hanging among other paintings with a tag labelling
it as a portrait by an unknown fifteenth century artist, most would
walk by without giving it a second look.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Social media often makes opinions appear &ldquo;true&rdquo; because they have many thousands of upvotes. It&rsquo;s rare that we go against the popular opinion.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s for this reason that in the recent rebuild of my blog I removed a views counter.</p>

                    <p>As I grow a little older views I once held collapse like a stack of cards under the gentle prod of criticism. No longer do I think creativity solely occupies the arts; anyone can be creative no matter what (or even in what) they do. It&rsquo;s only apt that I&rsquo;ll use one example in this post from another domain.</p>

<p>For some time I&rsquo;ve held the view that removing creative variables from a creative problem actually <em>encourages</em> creativity. In programming, the simpler solution to a complex problem is usually the best one. Writing code with fewer abstractions in mind (and writing simple tests) can allow programmers to think more creatively.</p>

<p>When we impose constraints (in other words removing the luxury of choice), we&rsquo;re often required to &ldquo;think outside the box&rdquo;; we frame our thinking around these constraints. A first draft of this post included references to lots of other areas where one might exhibit creativity but I think the axiom needs no clarification: constraint breeds creativity. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>

                    <p>The reason it&rsquo;s so difficult to define the human experience without using examples is because it&rsquo;s so diverse, unpredictable, sporadic, <em>messy</em>. Human life is diverse by definition; When did you ever see two strangers walk past each other in the street wearing exactly the same clothes?</p>

<p>Feel like everything is so&hellip; <em>boring</em> lately? So samey?</p>

<p>The working week is draining. You put your laptop to sleep and swipe through some of the headlines on your phone, praying for just one scrap of positivity. Yes, Boris Johnson&rsquo;s a shit. Aren&rsquo;t they all? You see a post on Facebook by a friend who clearly feels the same. Thirty likes (blimey even a few loves) and five others in the comments agree. One even says how brave your friend is for &ldquo;speaking out&rdquo;.</p>

<p>You switch over to Youtube. Time to kick back. You skip out on your subscriptions for today, going straight to the homepage for something new. You&rsquo;ve watched that Office clip of Jim&rsquo;s pranks on Dwight at least fifteen times so another can&rsquo;t hurt. It&rsquo;s not funny per s√© but it makes you feel &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Netflix notifies you about an interesting new documentary but when you load up the app on your TV you don&rsquo;t see it anywhere. You watch a couple of episodes of Rick &amp; Morty while your dinner cooks.</p>

<p>Later, as you&rsquo;re about to go to bed you decide to check in on Hinge. You don&rsquo;t have notifications switched on to save you from the abject disappointment of never getting notified. But it tells you there isn&rsquo;t anyone new to look at today, even though there wasn&rsquo;t anyone the day before and the day before that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must all be too busy watching that Netflix documentary&rdquo;, you lament.</p>

                    <p>To be really good at anything means doing it a lot. Sure, there are some shortcuts but no great writer, artist, musician, athlete etc has so far been able to fake hard work and determination. There is simply no replacement for it.</p>

<p>An easy way to spend a lot of time doing something is by necessity: cooking, exercise and writing, to name just a few activities. You may even end up enjoying some of these as you find your skill grows and you surpass others.</p>

<p>There is also no replacement for the overwhelming satisfaction and pride that hard work and determination inevitably leads to. This is an innate, selfish need we all have but one that belongs entirely to us and us alone.</p>

<p>We are all just sailboats on a stream, taking our time.</p>
