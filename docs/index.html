                    <p>In one of my favourite &ldquo;Curb Your Enthusiam&rdquo; scenes Larry&rsquo;s assistant gets a tattoo but when he asks her what it means, she says &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very personal. I don&rsquo;t share it with everybody&rdquo;. He replies, &ldquo;The whole world can see it but it&rsquo;s personal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve sometimes wondered what idea or symbol is so timeless that I&rsquo;d want it permanently tattooed on my skin. Perhaps it would be the AFC Bournemouth crest or a pair of cherries, but then lately I&rsquo;ve felt so disillusioned by the ethics of football: the extortionate sums of money spent on players; the Saudi State; rape allegations, homophobia, racism, drug abuse, CO2 emissions etc.</p>

<p>Football fans it seems, alternate between love and hate for their own players on an almost weekly basis. Overall it feels so transiently insignificant, so fickle.</p>

                    <p>I spent years grappling with a feeling of inferiority having not graduated from university. When I finished school at eighteen I studied TV Production in Gloucestershire, despite my only interest having really been film; my father wouldn&rsquo;t support this in the belief that TV was where the jobs were. My main interest as a teenager had been photography but there was also no possibility my parents would support me in that. Upon reflection, I think photography was one of the only things I was ever truly good at. I left university after a year with ~twelve thousand pounds of debt and depression.</p>

<p>I have no regrets having spent a considerable part of my life programming. I think I&rsquo;m fairly good at it as well.</p>

<p>At several stages in adulthood I&rsquo;ve looked into the possibility of returning to university in some capacity. Firstly, I feel I missed out on the opportunity to <em>study</em>. It was only as an adult that I discovered how much I really enjoy learning new things; any kind of passion I&rsquo;d had for learning at school was thoroughly drummed out of me during GCSE &amp; A-Level study; I read <em>hundreds</em> of books in my early teenage years before having to answer inane essay questions about which &ldquo;literary techniques Bronte employed in Jane Eyre&rdquo;. Incidentally, novelists don&rsquo;t consciously employ techniques as if ticking off items on a shopping list, they read.</p>

<p>Secondly, graduating from university has always felt like a club I wasn&rsquo;t part of. My parents, my sister, most of friends. Most of them describe it as a total waste of time, but a walled garden I may never have access to nonetheless.</p>

<p>The barriers to attending university seem too great: I would have to study A-Levels relevant to the subjects I want to learn about, which might take years with a full-time job. And what would it lead to if not another job? Why would I forgo gainful employment for the possibility of something else? It&rsquo;s not as though I hate what I do currently.</p>

<p>At the weekend I finished reading &ldquo;Masters of Doom&rdquo; which follows &ldquo;The Two Johns&rdquo; (Romero and Carmack) (founders of id Software) who would make games like Wolfenstein 3-D, Doom and Quake and bring about vast cultural change in the process. Neither of the Johns graduated from university. Carmack, who was largely self-taught, would conduct his own research so that he could solve difficult graphics problems. It was incredibly humbling to read about the two prodigious programmers, who later went on to become hugely successful (in every sense of that word).</p>

                    <p>While out drinking with my programmer friends at the weekend, naturally the subject of ChatGPT arose. We laughed about it, comparing the way you can ask it to generate random pictures to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8K6QUPmv8Q" target="_blank">Celery Man</a>. While I laugh, there&rsquo;s a slightly eerie feeling at the back of my mind that perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t be. That at some point in time it might not seem so funny.</p>

<p>Often as someone &ldquo;in the know&rdquo; I feel differently on hot-button technology subjects to how my non-technical friends and family feel. Take WhatsApp being asked to create backdoors to make it easier for government agencies to hunt down terrorists and child abusers; I can totally see why you&rsquo;d be concerned by those things, but knowing what I do about the benefits of encryption I&rsquo;m aware of the other risks. I&rsquo;m not very knowledgeable about AI or what it&rsquo;s capable of, other than that I know its current limitation is that it requires human input, so we&rsquo;re still some way away from something that &ldquo;thinks&rdquo; for itself.</p>

<p>One of my programmer friends thinks there is nothing to stop the proliferation of AI. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unstoppable. It&rsquo;s inevitable that some people will lose their jobs&rdquo;, he says. He also works in tech and makes good money. The people working on the cutting edge of AI (and with vested interests in it) are hugely wealthy and have likely spent most of their lives in the belief that their work will push humanity forward. I wonder how much sympathy they have for the working classes, sympathy for the Customer Service Representative with no university education. Attempts to automate entry-level jobs (that our economy thrives on) like these with bots <a href="https://twitter.com/guntrip/status/1640694869785030657?s=20" target="_blank">might seem silly now</a>, but I&rsquo;d hazard a guess they soon won&rsquo;t be. Those of us who work in tech are all incredibly lucky; I think about this every day.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I have any reason to be worried about my job. The application I work on is highly complex and configurable. By the time you&rsquo;d explained what it does to a machine in English, you&rsquo;d have built the entire thing from scratch anyway. English might not even be the ideal way to explain it but at least it&rsquo;s how us humans think (and dream) about applications now. Perhaps I could describe a service and some endpoints to ChatGPT and it could probably produce an Echo server with working code, but the limit to how accurate it&rsquo;s going to be is how much detail I&rsquo;m willing to go into.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a subculture that seems to have appeared on some parts of Reddit and Hacker News recently: choosing the prompts that your AI art is created from. I find it totally absurd that anyone would think this could be considered a &ldquo;skill&rdquo; but people already do, as though choosing 10 words requires anything like the level of skill required to draw or paint well. Thankfully we do consider skill when we think about the quality of art, which is why a Rembrandt knockoff doesn&rsquo;t cost you anywhere near as much as the real thing.</p>

<p>I imagine the future (at least for programmers) will be some augmentation of what we currently do: auto generated code snippets. I can&rsquo;t imagine a self-checking, self-moderating machine that turns Jira tickets into an application you never touch or see. There will still be code, edited and validated by humans.</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t see people losing their jobs in the face of this technology as an &ldquo;inevitability&rdquo; either. It certainly doesn&rsquo;t have to be, unless those in charge let it be. We&rsquo;ve developed a much better understanding of how to live with technology than ~170 years ago. I only hope that we don&rsquo;t give in to the lazy, big tech optimism that got us into so much trouble in the past. Let&rsquo;s stop pretending the big-tech CEOs and SV investors of this world care about the interests of the common person like they say they do; they don&rsquo;t.</p>

                    <p>I&rsquo;ve spent a great deal of time over the last few years thinking about why some things are better than others, particularly art. There&rsquo;s a common view that if the purpose of art is to appeal to humans, the &ldquo;best&rdquo; art is that which appeals to the greatest number. I hold the view that popularity is not necessarily a measure of quality, but <a href="/some-quality-biases/">a bias</a>.</p>

<p>When my girlfriend and I recently visited Arundel we came across <a href="https://www.kimsbookshops.co.uk/arundel/" target="_blank">Kim&rsquo;s Books</a>, with tens of thousands of titles on its shelves. I found myself gravitating only towards the authors I&rsquo;d heard of and there simply wouldn&rsquo;t have been enough time to discover something new (not that either of us had come with any particular titles in mind). The impression the experience gave me was that not all works are timeless; likely most will be forgotten about in time. For how long will people continue to read novels?</p>

<p>I feel a couple of ideas coming together. Long have I been preoccupied with quality but there are many books, movies and songs that I like that aren&rsquo;t considerd critically-speaking &ldquo;good&rdquo;. Not by critics, not by anyone. I like them because they <em>resonate with me</em>, on an emotional or intellectual level. I don&rsquo;t mean to say that &ldquo;all art is subjective&rdquo; which the majority seem to believe these days, because I don&rsquo;t think the subjective/objective model is the be all and end all; there <em>are</em> &ldquo;better&rdquo; forms of art than others and the right answer is probably a bit more nuanced; I&rsquo;ve skirted around what I think this is in various blog posts here. I&rsquo;m starting to feel that to create something that resonates with at least one other person (someone you know even) is just as much the mark of &ldquo;success&rdquo; as anything that resonates with many people, but I do fully-well appreciate that &ldquo;great&rdquo; works are usually popular.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing poems for the last three or so months. I always thought poetry was for hacks, but I&rsquo;ve never really had the patience for long fiction and I find writing fun little verses accessible (at least on the surface). In this sense, writing poems feels like what photography is to painting: both involve the study of light but the former is at least in this day and age easier to get started with. But I say &ldquo;only on the surface&rdquo; because like many of the arts, to create something truly resonant takes time and patience.</p>

<p>Sometimes I find writing poems difficult when I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of music by a single artist, as I often do (I almost never skip around). It influences me so greatly I find it impossible to write anything not in the style of, or to the beat of the music I&rsquo;ve been listening to. In fact the other day I wrote an entire poem only to realise it had the exact same rhythmn as John Prine&rsquo;s &ldquo;One Red Rose&rdquo; (though I prefer the Iris DeMent version).</p>

<p>Pirsig wrote about something similar. After the publication of &ldquo;Zen&hellip;&rdquo; he said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&rdquo;&hellip;there&rsquo;s an adage to remember, &lsquo;Reading is the enemy of writing.&rsquo; I remember telling that to Kay Sexton at B. Dalton who threw up her hands and said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say that! You&rsquo;ll put us out of business!&rsquo; But it&rsquo;s true. Any time I did read a book during the years of writing ZMM and Lila it would stop the writing for as much as a week while memories of what I just read or heard gradually faded. That was also true of movies, TV, and parties.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is inspiration if not emotional resonance? Artists are inspired by other artists, probably more indirectly than we think, since to read Seneca is not to understand Marcus Aurelius&rsquo; &ldquo;Meditations&rdquo;. The latter is <em>inspired</em> by the ideas of the former but after all when the dust settles, they are separate works by separate authors.</p>

                    <p>At the denouement of the 2018 film &ldquo;Under the Silver Lake&rdquo; a character staring into the eyes of the protagonist delivers the following monologue with great conviction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a world that anyone with much sense stays in or spends much time worrying about. You&rsquo;re living in a carnival, throwing plastic rings at oversized pop bottles, hoping to win a prize. What are you going to win? A two-week vacation? New car? A little money to retire on? It&rsquo;s all just a shitty, sawdust-filled rabbit. The things you care about are useless when we&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Often when a character delivers their &ldquo;master plan&rdquo; monologue we&rsquo;re suppose to write them off as delusional, but I think the director had other ideas. I&rsquo;m sure there are lots of us who would likely share this character&rsquo;s cynicism - many people today describe themselves as &ldquo;realists&rdquo; but the divide is increasingly narrow when the world feels so depraved; the news seems to only show us stories of death, corruption, greed, injustice etc.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to separate &ldquo;the world&rdquo; from &ldquo;my world&rdquo;. The former is how I perceive wars in foreign countries I&rsquo;ve never been to, the election of the next prime minister, generalised ideas of human behaviour etc. I experience almost all of these things through television and the internet and by-in-large my actions have very little effect on them (more on this later). The latter is my personal, direct experience: things I see, taste, hear, people I have conversations with, my family, friends, colleagues. What should be more important, the former or the latter?</p>

<p>One of the attitudes that I feel is most prevalent in the West is &ldquo;those things are happening the other side of the world and so don&rsquo;t affect me&rdquo;. While our news sites do sometimes cover stories about atrocities in other parts of the world these are quickly forgotten about as journalists and news outlets choose other things to draw our attention to. But mostly these events are not likely to influence how we live our lives (as deeply saddening as they are) because we don&rsquo;t think anything like them is ever going to happen to us.</p>

<p>At the beginning of Covid-19 pandemic, many of us thought there was no likelihood of the virus (that was at the time infecting thousands of Chinese citizens) ever reaching our shores. For one of the first times in my life I saw first-hand an intersection between &ldquo;my world&rdquo; and &ldquo;the world&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly easy to accept ideas outside of the box of rationality and correctness most of us live in. That&rsquo;s not just because when things feel so bleak we naturally look for alternatives, but being right all the time and believing everyone else to be wrong is also tiresome; it&rsquo;s freeing to not feel the need to scrutinise every belief that falls outside of what you consider &ldquo;true&rdquo;. What also seemed to quickly emerge during the Covid pandemic was the need to live our lives by the empirical and undeniable Truth. It was what scientists told us about the virus that influenced how we behaved, except the message wasn&rsquo;t always singular and clear and there were people in our lives who seemed to be more in-the-know than the rest of us - who we gave a voice (and a sense of self-importance) to. In the end there was really no single truth, only our many varied individual truths.</p>

<p>The reason why a lot of us don&rsquo;t seem to care very much about climate change is because it too falls victim to the &ldquo;that&rsquo;s happening on the other side of the world and doesn&rsquo;t affect me&rdquo; mentality, the key difference with Covid-19 being that its effects are not yet obvious and immediate to us where we live. Despite temperatures here in the UK being higher last week than they&rsquo;ve been for almost fifty years, nobody&rsquo;s death certificate will have any mention of climate change (but it might say heatstroke).</p>

<p>What I find overwhelmingly sad is the people who truly believe this (whom I so desperately want to be wrong) are in some ways right. The first people to be affected by climate change, to die, to be displaced, to starve aren&rsquo;t anywhere near the UK. They&rsquo;re in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and the hottest regions of the planet.</p>

<p>It will take a majority of people challenging our notion of what is &ldquo;correct&rdquo; for us to figure out how to slow down the effects of climate change, to embrace the heterodox ideas and the moonshots, to remove the carbon already in our atmosphere.</p>
