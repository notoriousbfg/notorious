				<p>Our perception of what it means to be successful is wrong. There&rsquo;s no universal standard.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a book or article, only finding someone I used to go to school with on Facebook that prompted me to think about my own perception of success. The person in question, who initially didn&rsquo;t perform well in their A Levels, is now a Physics student with some of the world&rsquo;s best universities under his belt.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that while his achievments are impressive, they&rsquo;re not mine either, nor do I hope to ever come close to achieving them. On the face of it, this isn&rsquo;t a particularly difficult idea to get one&rsquo;s head around. Let&rsquo;s hear this one more time.</p>

<p>Other people&rsquo;s achievments are their own.</p>

<p>On the flip side, if my goal was to study Physics at the best intitutions in the world, what then? Would I have achieved &lsquo;success&rsquo; if I reached my goal? What would I aspire to do after? The reality is, nobody knows. I&rsquo;d have to get there to find out and probaby take multiple unexpected turns along the way.</p>

<p>As I start to think about where I sit on my own path to success, I realise there&rsquo;s really no end. As a developer I continue to grow, but ultimately I decide when I&rsquo;ve accomplished something with enough substance to have acquired it.</p>
