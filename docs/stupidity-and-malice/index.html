				<p>After publishing my last post, &ldquo;Building Software, Sharing Knowledge&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ve been thinking more about an idea I touched on:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Rarely do we just blindly do things without giving them any thought and so it&rsquo;s always best to assume that past decisions were made with some level of consideration.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While we often like to assume that past decisions were stupid, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re as common as we&rsquo;d like to think they are.</p>

<p>Invariably, in all aspects of life (including work) there is context to another person&rsquo;s actions, often that we cannot understand. Without this context we may incorrectly perceive their actions as stupid and sometimes even malicious.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I find that our inclination to see things this way is usually indicative of our general feelings about a person.</p>
