				<p>One of the many great revelations in my career so far has been learning the difference between criticism of work and criticism of an individual. Many developers I&rsquo;ve worked with assume that to receive criticism for a piece of work is a comment on their ability, which I can relate to, considering that we tend to take so much personal responsibility for our work.</p>

<p>When an individual understands that criticism (when delivered in a respectful way) is a tool for greater collaboration, clarity and creativity, a team is able to focus solely on producing better work.</p>

<p>In Creativity Inc, Ed Catmull discusses the use of the word &lsquo;candor&rsquo;: to be forthright or frank, instead of &lsquo;honesty&rsquo;, which carries moral connotations. The Braintrust, an elite group of Pixar&rsquo;s best writers and directors is built on this principle. As Catmull writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&rdquo;&hellip;without the critical ingredient that is candor, there can be no trust. And without trust, creative collaboration is not possible.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This principle eludes most people, but it is critical: You are not your idea, and if you identify too closely with your ideas, you will take offense when they are challenged. To set up a healthy feedback system, you must remove power dynamics from the equation - you must enable yourself, in other words, to focus on the problem, not the person.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
