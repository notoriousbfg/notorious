				<p>Over the last 12 months I&rsquo;ve been able to lose around 80lbs in body weight. For the most part this will have been from exercise, but I also eat reasonably well.</p>

<p>The following is one (very subjective) order of operations for improving your diet.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If it isn&rsquo;t good for you. Don&rsquo;t buy it.
If I have crappy food in my fridge I will always eat it. I know this because in every instance that I can think of that I&rsquo;ve brought something that was bad for me home, I&rsquo;ve eaten it in one sitting or the same day.
To satisfy my sweet-tooth cravings I buy low sugar/low fat yogurts and fruit. I like eating both and I eat only what I like the taste of. If I get bored of a type of fruit or brand, I try a different one.</p></li>

<li><p>Exercise first.
Most cardio equipment at the gym will give you a rough indication of how many calories you&rsquo;ve burned. If you enter your body weight, Strava can do the same. When you&rsquo;re conscious of the number of calories you can burn and the time and effort it requires to do so, you&rsquo;ll start to think more about how many you consume from food.
For example, I can burn 550 calories by running 5km. This might take me 25 minutes and if I try hard I&rsquo;ll want it to be over at the end. A side of fries will bring me close to this and the effort I&rsquo;ve put in will have been cancelled out.</p></li>

<li><p>Pay attention to serving size.
Food packaging displays the fat, sugar and salt values for eating a certain quantity of food. Don&rsquo;t assume that a green label means something is empirically &ldquo;healthy&rdquo;. Ensure that you&rsquo;re content with eating only the amount that the packaging states and if you do eat more, be mindful of how much fat, sugar and salt you&rsquo;re consuming in one day. E.g. a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pack of fresh pasta is 20% of my daily intake, so a whole pack is 40%.</p></li>

<li><p>If you want to eat rubbish food, go ahead.
It&rsquo;s human to crave something sweet or oily every so often. Suppressing those urges will only make the cravings worse. It&rsquo;s fine to eat unhealthy food once in a while as long as you moderate your intake. Assuming you&rsquo;re also exercising, you won&rsquo;t feel like eating crap all the time anyway.</p></li>
</ol>
