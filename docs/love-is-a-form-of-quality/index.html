<p>They say all poets must have an unrequited love.<br>
As all lovers must have though-provoking fears.<br>
&ndash; <cite>Terence Trent D&rsquo;Arby, Holding On To You</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If quality is a perceptual experience, then love is too. So much of culture rests on love but our own ideas vary so wildly - influenced by many things, including our parents&rsquo; relationships and our own.</p>

<p>Love can be reduced to high levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. And it can be built up in art and music.</p>

<p>But love is observable. It is usually fairly obvious when two people are in love (and sometimes not) e.g. We observe two lovers having a conversation in a park and judge by their interaction that they are in love.</p>

<p>Love is a form of quality because it precedes intellectual thought, influenced by all of our own biases. But it is also real and true.</p>
