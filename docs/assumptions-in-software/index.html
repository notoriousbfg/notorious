				<p>Most of us make a variety of assumptions during our working day. If we didn&rsquo;t we&rsquo;d have to assess every problem from every possible angle in a logical way, which I think we&rsquo;d all agree would become very tiresome quickly.</p>

<p>Most of the time we make partial assumptions based on pieces of the whole picture; this includes either information we&rsquo;ve observed first hand or collected by others. Sometimes we even make a priori assumptions based on no first-hand observation at all.</p>

<p>Software Engineers are very good at identifying patterns but I think an unfortunate trap we often fall into is linking disparate ideas, especially in the absence of a complete picture. Often I hear engineers say that because they&rsquo;ve found a bug today, the bug has existed since the feature was created. It&rsquo;s an easy (and quite egotistical) assumption but invariably a flawed one.</p>

<p>How can we know whether an assumption is right if we&rsquo;re acting on incomplete information? All correct assumptions (that we may not discover were right until some time has passed) have a clear, reproducible line of reasoning. While there might be huge gaps in the breadcrumb trail between two seemingly unrelated ideas, bread fragments will always line the path between logical assumptions.</p>
