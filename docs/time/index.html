<p>&ldquo;It is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much&hellip; The
life we receive is not short but we make it so; we are not ill provided
but use what we have wastefully.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Lucius Annaeus Seneca</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Typically when we write about time in a romantic way it&rsquo;s to describe its fleeting nature: Time is finite, irreplaceable and escaping.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve come to think the opposite. For most of us, the passing of time helps us see things in a different light; It helps us recover from trauma and pain; It helps us save what we want to, forget what we want to; It changes how we perceive our own lives.</p>

<p>More time can be a wonderful elixir for regret, which is simply sadness at the passing of time. Whether we regret something we said, did, or didn&rsquo;t do more time would allow us to correct our mistakes (or so we think).  But to live life with regret is itself regrettable.</p>

<p>In recent years I&rsquo;ve come to love the music of John Prine, who sadly passed away in 2020. But while much of his music is tinged with sadness, there is hope in the song &ldquo;I Remember Everything&rdquo;, which describes brief snapshots throughout his life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been down this road before<br>
Alone as I can be<br>
Careful not to let my past<br>
Go sneaking up on me<br>
Got no future in my happiness<br>
Though regrets are very few<br>
Sometimes a little tenderness<br>
Was the best that I could do</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s a pleasant reminder that we can remember all the good in our lives, free from regret if we try.</p>
