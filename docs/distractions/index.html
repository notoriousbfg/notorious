				<p>Distractions often have a negative connotation. We say &ldquo;I want to spend less time watching TV because it distracts me from doing [insert other activity]&rdquo;, but realistically trying to do less of something is hard without self-control.</p>

<p>Instead, finding other hobbies and interests to distract oneself with is a better idea. Ideally this is something you&rsquo;re already at least partly familiar with; placing too much emphasis on something new is a surefire way to lose interest.</p>

<p>I find that if I don&rsquo;t find an activity engaging enough, like for example reading, I simply find books that interest me. If the project I&rsquo;m working on isn&rsquo;t exciting enough, I find one that is.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve found my interest for programming waning and spending more time playing video games, but I recognise I could be doing something more meaningful. Where no obvious interest exists (I haven&rsquo;t been able to run as I&rsquo;m carrying a knee injury) I&rsquo;m exploring several other hobbies, though I think it&rsquo;s important to have a balance of things I can do at home and those with other people or in public. Failing that, I see what my friends are up to, whom I always have time for.</p>
