				<p><strong>03/01/23: I have set this post to draft because I don&rsquo;t think it is particularly insightful or coherent, but there are some good ideas I may pull out into other posts.</strong></p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t written anything here for a while because my mind has been in other places creatively and intellectually, but ultimately life just gets in the way. However, I created <a href="/feed">timstagram</a> for sharing brief entries, sources of inspiration and my art and poetry.</p>

<p><strong>What am I writing about?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Things that appear easy on the surface but require more investment.</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Finding new interests is about finding a balance between things you&rsquo;re good at and that you enjoy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Most things that are worth doing require practice.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Have you ever felt compelled to bring a piece to life?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I think most people to spend any considerable amount of time doing something must believe they&rsquo;re good at it, at least at first. It&rsquo;s rare to slog away at something for years thinking you&rsquo;re bad, but then again many creative processes are inherently fun. I&rsquo;m not an accomplished painter (and it wouldn&rsquo;t be the first thing I&rsquo;d talk about at a dinner party) but I enjoy applying paint to canvas and mixing colours and textures.</p>

<p>I first took up photography as a teenager because I thought it was easy, or on the surface had the appearance of something that was easy. My early explorations with a compact digital camera allowed me to document all the things and happenings in my life, and eventually the people around me. While in my late teens I became somewhat technically proficient at taking pictures, my camera became the main outlet for my creativity, shooting on film with my Pentax K1000. Unfortunately, the school I attended didn&rsquo;t have a photography department so it was very much a solitary pursuit for me.</p>

<p>At the age of eighteen I wrote to the photographer Alec Soth asking for advice and he very kindly sent back some of his zines, telling me, &ldquo;&hellip;all I can say is that I had [the same] fear of photographing strangers. For me, photography is like therapy. So I encourage you to go out and give it a shot. Hell, come to Minnesota and take my picture.&rdquo; I imagined making photographs like the other young artists I admired (Olivia Bee especially) but learned that in order to make art that truly resonated emotionally with others, I needed to connect with my subjects and subject matter on a deeper level. There&rsquo;s a stunning photograph of a young couple in Vanessa Winship&rsquo;s &ldquo;She Dances on Jackson&rdquo; forever imprinted on my brain, but I can&rsquo;t imagine what she said to them beforehand to illicit those poses/expressions [1]. Forming a deeper relationship with my subjects would require a considerable amount of time (and an income to buy film and chemicals) so I could undertake projects, neither of which I had. My father wouldn&rsquo;t let me train to become a photographer (because he thought it was oversubscribed) so I went to university to become a TV cameraman instead and left after a year.</p>

<p><img title="" src="/easy/1.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>While I don&rsquo;t make pictures so often these days (I take the odd snapshot on my phone here and there) I can still visualise the process, framing beautiful scenes, natural light. I rifle through old slides and see only the frayed edges of what might have been, but I suspect if I pursued photography as a hobby now it would be some time before I could think of myself as being &ldquo;good&rdquo; again.</p>

<p>Being so out of practice in the mind is like being unfit in the body: when I haven&rsquo;t been running (from illness, for example) I usually find it takes the same amount of training that I wasn&rsquo;t, to get back to where I was before (a comparable pace/time). But taking good photographs is about training your brain to think a certain way: you <em>hunt</em> for the perfect image until it becomes instinctive. That&rsquo;s why I can visualise the process (like imagining myself running without putting on my trainers and going outside). Training your brain like this feels quite tiresome when you don&rsquo;t have a camera on your person (your running shoes) so you do, always.</p>

<p>With age, I find my baseline of what I consider &ldquo;good&rdquo; to be rising and I&rsquo;m increasingly self-critical of anything I make; I have to remind myself that starting anything (for everyone) takes some time and effort to become good. Sometimes I cringe at the artworks I made as a child, or the little songs I&rsquo;d write on my guitar in an afternoon but then my efforts then were so unapologetically uninhibited by my own standards; where these come from in adulthood I haven&rsquo;t a clue. As with all creative processes one must play and experiment before finding flow, something you cannot do if your enjoyment is rooted in your perception of the quality of the outcome; you must inherently enjoy the process, the plight.</p>

<p>Photography is more playful now that we all have discreet, high powered cameras in our pockets. It seems socially acceptable to point your mobile phone at anything or anyone in the street but point a lens and people duck out the way.</p>

<p><strong>Elaborate a little on why the practice of photography might be different - you need to bridge these paragraphs</strong></p>

<p>I wish I could say I&rsquo;ve always thought of photographs as being an effective way to tell stories. A <em>series</em> of photographs is being more analogous to poetry anthologies than a novel. There are certainly ways of sequencing photographs that communicate meaning (Soth has spoken about this extensively) but single photographs will always be (in my mind) &ldquo;incomplete&rdquo;: they create the illusion of presenting the world as it &ldquo;is&rdquo;, but are merely an opinionated representation. I think that&rsquo;s part of the appeal to artists; what&rsquo;s not said can almost be as moving as that which is, though there are lots of successful photographic series&rsquo; that tell a more &ldquo;complete&rdquo; story (like the wonderful &ldquo;The Epilogue&rdquo; by Leia Abril, which I remember had a remarkable impact on me as a young man.)</p>

<p>These days however I feel taking my phone out of my pocket takes me too far out of the experience I&rsquo;m having: I can&rsquo;t be <a href="/presence">present</a> if my mind is searching for light, for angles, for the corners of a flat plane on the scene I&rsquo;m looking at. In my mind, <em>taking</em> pictures nowadays feels not like an exploration of space but a flattening, a reduction. Earlier this year I read &ldquo;Spring Cannot Be Cancelled&rdquo; about the painter David Hockney in which the author writes, &ldquo;Just as the camera does not see space or sunsets as the human eye and brain perceive them, neither does it register the colours of flowers in the way that we experience them. That is why photographing a spring meadow, for example, is a frustrating business. Where you see a mass of wild blooms - red, yellow, blue, and white - the lens minimizes these hues and records mainly grass and leaves&rdquo;. Teenage me would have likely argued to the bitter end against this but now I see the truth in it. Hockney later says, &ldquo;Photographs of sunsets are always clich√©s. That&rsquo;s because they show just one moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img title="" src="/easy/2.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I started writing poetry earlier this year because on the surface it too appeared easy. You can write a half-decent-sounding ten-line poem in an afternoon on the back of a postcard and send it to your girlfriend. Much like photography, you get the instant satisfaction of having created something; even better when it rhymes or there&rsquo;s a patter. Much like making pictures, when you get into the habit of writing poems more often you train your brain to notice, you listen out for sayings and expressions and words that roll off the tongue and that pique your interest.</p>

<p>I find poetry interesting because often its &ldquo;true&rdquo; form doesn&rsquo;t emerge until you&rsquo;ve already written some or all of it. Not like painting where usually the piece follows the direction of those first strokes [2]. And certainly not like photography, where a bad photograph will always remain a bad photograph. You have to cut and reshape your own work with indifference, while still retaining enough of the magic, threads of gold: rhythmn and rhyme. Reading the poetry of others (or listening) is a whole other kind of education. &ldquo;Wait, all this time I could write in the third person?&rdquo;, you lament. It&rsquo;s easy to write terribly self-interested poetry: How can you hope to connect with others if you only ever write about your own experiences - if you see nothing but yourself? In his Masterclass the poet Billy Collins says &ldquo;What you have to do in your poetry is tell a little white lie&hellip; that you love poetry more than you love yourself&rdquo;. A good poem is one that has to be read aloud as though the poem wrote itself; Bad poetry always sounds bad aloud.</p>

<p><strong>Wrap up</strong></p>

<p><del>I find a lot of people who don&rsquo;t write code perceive it to be some incredibly complex skill but most of us with just a couple of years experience know there are simple patterns; we&rsquo;re hunting for cues just as a photographer or poet does, but instead of light, colour and contrast, we look for so-called &ldquo;abstractions&rdquo; and they&rsquo;re common or there are equivalents across most programming languages. I used to work with a guy who insisted on using a green and black terminal theme (it was probably just default iTerm) because non-technical colleagues would walk past his desk and jokingly say things like &ldquo;are you in the Matrix?&rdquo; even though I knew he was just doing trivial git stuff. I think he liked being seen that way a bit [3].</del></p>

<p><del>With coding I find flow more than anything else, with the right balance of ease (I&rsquo;m relatively good at it now) and challenge (discovering new things, possibly even about myself). As long as neither is too great, my trajectory is always upward, ideally at a constant rate. But life isn&rsquo;t really like this: the rate at which we learn varies greatly. Sometimes I find coding quite addictive because you get lots of little bursts of success: you write some code here, you tweak it there, you write a little more. With each successful build or page refresh you feel the reward of your efforts: It&rsquo;s nothing like say learning an instrument in this regard where it might be months before you feel flow: probably why the piano I bought during lockdown collects dust. Some things are harder than others.</del></p>

I have fond a fond memory of buying the last copy of &ldquo;She Dances on Jackson&rdquo; at Claire de Rouen books (a lovely little art bookshop, when it was in Charing Cross Rd) after seeing the Patrick Caulfield/Gary Hume exhibition at the Tate Britain. Years later I bought Paul Graham&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Whiteness of the Whale&rdquo; at Koenig Books (just across the road, now also closed) after seeing William Eggleston at the Tate Modern with my sister.</p>

<p>[2] In &ldquo;The Art Spirit&rdquo; Robert Henri says, &ldquo;The value of repeated studies of <em>beginnings</em> of a painting cannot be over-estimated. Those who cannot begin do not finish.&rdquo; I think about this often.</p>

<p><del>[3] Funnily enough, thinking programming was &ldquo;what smart people do&rdquo; is one of the reasons I took it up in the first place; I had watched &ldquo;The Internship&rdquo; with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaugn and decided I was going to learn how to code and work at Google, having thought I wasn&rsquo;t particularly clever up to that point. (We were all young and na√Øve once.) I&rsquo;ve met some stupid people who code but most are, unsurprisingly, pretty clever (including &ldquo;the iTerm guy&rdquo;, now one of my closest friends). We still argue today about a piece of code we originally had an argument about back in 2016. All one of us needs to say is &ldquo;single letter variables&rdquo;.</del></p>
