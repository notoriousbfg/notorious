				<p>I haven&rsquo;t published anything here for a while because my mind has been in other places creatively and intellectually, but ultimately life just gets in the way. As my driving instructor says &ldquo;Life is unfair, Tim. Entropy prevails.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="/easy/1.jpg" alt="Classic cars convention" /></p>

<p>What am I writing about?</p>

<ul>
<li>Things that appear easy on the surface but require more investment.</li>
<li>Feeling compelled to bring an ouvre to life.</li>
</ul>

<p>I  think most people, to spend any considerable time doing something, must believe they&rsquo;re good at it. It&rsquo;s rare to slog away at something for years thinking you&rsquo;re bad at it. But then again, many creative processes are inherently fun. I&rsquo;m not the best painter but I enjoy applying paint to canvas, mixing colours and textures. For Christmas I made a friend a photo album which he loved, despite the countless mistakes I made. It was a joy to make, having only made pamphlets until that point.</p>

<p>I first took up photography as a teenager because I thought it was easy, or had the appearance of something that was easy. My early explorations with a compact digital camera allowed me to document all the things and happenings in my life, and eventually the people around me. In 2012, aged 18, I wrote to the photographer Alec Soth asking for his advice on photographing strangers and he very kindly sent back some of his zines, telling me, &ldquo;&hellip;all I can say is that I had [the same] fear of photographing strangers. For me, photography is like therapy. So I encourage you to go out and give it a shot. Hell, come to Minnesota and take my picture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While I later became quite technically proficient at photography, I would not only document the world around me but would use it to express myself and my ideas creatively. I imagined myself making photographs like other young artists I admired (Olivia Bee comes to mind) but recognised that in order to make art that truly resonated emotionally with others, I needed to connect with my subjects and subject matter on a deeper level. There&rsquo;s a stunning photograph of a young couple in Vanessa Winship&rsquo;s &ldquo;She Dances on Jackson&rdquo; forever imprinted on my brain; the subjects&rsquo; expressions tell us so much about where they are in their lives; I can&rsquo;t imagine what she said to them beforehand. Forming a deeper relationship with my subjects would require a considerable amount of time (and enough money) neither of which I had. My father wouldn&rsquo;t let me train to become a photographer (because he thought it was oversubscribed) so I took a stab at becoming a TV cameraman instead and failed.</p>

<p>While I don&rsquo;t <em>make</em> pictures so often these days (I take the odd snapshot on my phone here and there) I can still visualise the process, framing beautiful scenes, natural light. I filter through old negatives and see only the frayed edges of what might have been; no, I suspect if I pursued photography as a hobby it would be some time before I could think of myself as being &ldquo;good&rdquo; again. I think of this as like being unfit: when I haven&rsquo;t been running (from illness, for example) I usually find it takes the same amount of training that I was out, to get back to where I was before. Taking good photographs is about training your brain to think a certain way; you &ldquo;hunt&rdquo; for the perfect image until it becomes instinctive; it&rsquo;s why I can visualise the process, like remembering the shape my fingers need to be in for a G chord on guitar despite having not played for years. Training your brain like this feels quite tiresome when you don&rsquo;t have a camera on your person (so you do, always). In a way these days, I feel it brings me out of the experience I&rsquo;m having: I can&rsquo;t be present if my mind is searching for light, for angles, for the corners of a flat plane on the scene I&rsquo;m looking at. On this train of thought, photographs feel less like an exploration of space but more like a reduction.</p>

<p>I wish I could say I think of photography as an effective way to tell stories. I see series of photographs as being more analogous to poetry anthologies than I do novels. There are certainly ways of sequencing photographs that communicate meaning (Soth has spoken about this extensively) but photographs will always be (in my mind) &ldquo;incomplete&rdquo;. I recently read &ldquo;Spring Cannot Be Cancelled&rdquo; in which the painter David Hockney says, &ldquo;&rdquo; <strong>TODO</strong></p>

<p>I started writing poetry earlier this year because on the surface it appeared easy. You can write a half-decent-sounding ten-line poem in an afternoon on the back of a postcard and send it to your girlfriend. Much like photography, it&rsquo;s easy to <strong>TODO</strong></p>

<p>In his Masterclass the poet Billy Collins says &ldquo;What you have to do in your poetry is tell a little white lie&hellip; that you love poetry more than you love yourself&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I think programming is the opposite. I find most people who don&rsquo;t code perceive it to be some incredibly complex skill but most of us with a couple of years experience know there are simple patterns. I used to work with a guy who insisted on using a green and black terminal theme (it was probably just default iTerm) because non-technical coworkers would walk past his desk and jokingly say things like &ldquo;are you in the Matrix?&rdquo; even though I knew he was just doing trivial git stuff. Funnily enough, thinking programming was &ldquo;what smart people do&rdquo; is one of the reasons I took it up in the first place; I had watched &ldquo;The Internship&rdquo; with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaugn and decided I was going to learn how to code and work at Google. (We were all young and naïve once!) I&rsquo;ve met lots of stupid people who code but most are, unsurprisingly, pretty clever.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a view in literature that the story dictates the form of the novel; it&rsquo;s important to choose a viewpoint that suits the subject matter best. But so many first-time novelists choose to write in the first person because their own perspective is the only one they know; editors and literary agents see their work as self-indulgent. In photography, the book &ldquo;TTP&rdquo; by Hayahisa Tomiyasu comes to mind: its style and design (its form) are informed by the nature of its photographs and subject matter.</p>

<p>I have been reading Haruki Murakami&rsquo;s latest collection of essays &ldquo;Novelist as a Vocation&rdquo; and&hellip;</p>
