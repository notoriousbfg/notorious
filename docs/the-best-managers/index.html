				<p>The best managers I&rsquo;ve worked for so far have had one thing in common: they all shield their teams from wider company bullshit, including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>The criticisms of higher-ups: department heads and CEOs with no understanding of empowerment.</li>
<li>Bureaucracy, politics, power struggles.</li>
<li>Feature requests disguised as bugs.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Urgent fixes&rdquo; that aren&rsquo;t really urgent at all.</li>
<li>Direct messages from people you&rsquo;ve never spoken to, hoping to circumvent processes.</li>
<li>Last minute changes to deliverables.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not having to worry about any of this <em>noise</em> has freed me up to focus solely on the work I&rsquo;ve been given and complete it to a high standard. I&rsquo;m very grateful to have worked under some wonderful managers, some of whom I call friends.</p>
