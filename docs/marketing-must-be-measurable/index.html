				<p>Recently on LinkedIn (of which I&rsquo;m no longer a member), a previous MD of mine wrote a post objecting to another marketer&rsquo;s claim that marketing needed to be measurable. His argument was that the brand impact of companies like Rolex and McDonald&rsquo;s was immeasurable and that the value their marketing creates extends beyond sales. It&rsquo;s an idea I&rsquo;ve heard others propagate during my experience in marketing agencies and one that frankly I&rsquo;ve never understood.</p>

<p>Why would any profit-making company spend money on an exercise designed to generate sales, that didn&rsquo;t? This seems even more pertinent to the current economic situation, with businesses forced to slash their marketing budgets in an attempt to save costs.</p>

<p>I can understand that for some large consumer brands, one aspect of their marketing might seek to create associations in customer&rsquo;s minds (e.g. McDonald&rsquo;s with needing a quick meal, Rolex with a wealthy lifestyle). However the rules that apply to these organisations simply don&rsquo;t apply to the vast majority of businesses.</p>

<p>How could anyone argue (for the vast majority of businesses) that marketing didn&rsquo;t need to represent some kind of measurable improvement? If not sales, then engagement, leads, enquiries etc. Businesses that don&rsquo;t see a measurable increase in these metrics are (generally) ones that don&rsquo;t survive. The brands aforementioned exist because people buy their products.</p>
