				<p>In 2017, on a previous version of this blog, I wrote <a href="/success">Success</a>. Certainly at the time the conclusion I&rsquo;d come to was revelatory for me. For years I&rsquo;d help up these absolute examples of what I thought success was: starting a successful business; having a novel published; winning a prestigious sporting event. If you hadn&rsquo;t accomplished things in this order of magnitude, you weren&rsquo;t successful. In fact, I&rsquo;d thought only a small proportion of people could truly consider themselves successful.</p>

<p>The realisation I came to at the time was that all forms of success are relative. There isn&rsquo;t one definition or &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; one must surpass to be successful; success pertains to the individual. Of course we can say that Usain Bolt is a successful athlete for breaking the world 100m record or that Warren Buffet is a successful businessman but these accomplishments are beyond the reach of the vast majority of mortals.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago on Hacker News I asked the question: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24364817">&ldquo;Is it possible to be objectively good at something?&rdquo;</a> I was really pleased with the range of really quite thoughtful responses I got back (and my question even touched the front page for a brief moment) but my favourite answer was this one from AnimalMuppet:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Objectively&rdquo; means that someone should be able to unambiguously tell, without having to apply any judgment.</p>

<p>And yes, it&rsquo;s possible. Am I objectively good at calculus? I passed the AP test. That&rsquo;s an objective measure.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not that simple, for at least two reasons. First, it&rsquo;s always possible to question the &ldquo;objective measure&rdquo;. Is the AP test a good test of whether someone is good at calculus? AP says so, but that&rsquo;s not actually any help. College admissions departments think so, too. But grad school admissions people don&rsquo;t think so at all, and neither do math department hiring committees. This shows the problem: There is a measure that can objectively be met or failed, but is it the right measure? How can you tell? Not objectively.</p>

<p>Second, in many fields, there is no analog to the AP test. Is Tolkein a good writer? Is the Mona Lisa a good painting? There is no clearly objective measure. The only measure is that many people think so; more people than think, say, my daughter&rsquo;s watercolor is a good painting. That&rsquo;s subjective, but at least it has the merit of being subjectively shared by many people. And with something like Mona Lisa, it&rsquo;s shared by many people across many years - it&rsquo;s not just today&rsquo;s fad. That&rsquo;s still subjective, but it&rsquo;s at least a subjectivity that has widespread agreement to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s a very comforting response because while they acknowledge that &ldquo;there is no clearly objective measure&rdquo;, no test that can measure how &ldquo;good&rdquo; something or someone is (or that cannot be questioned), they also recognise that to be &ldquo;good&rdquo; is totally subjective. The closest thing to any kind of definitive measure of how good something we have is &ldquo;the merit of being subjectively shared by many people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s very important to focus on the subjectivity of what is good. It would be dangerous of me here to confuse being &ldquo;good&rdquo; at something with success, to say that an individual&rsquo;s success depends on the number of people to have shared and agreed that what they&rsquo;ve done is good, especially in this current age we live in. It&rsquo;s perfectly possible to be good at something but not be considered &ldquo;successful&rdquo;. Take the footballer Phil Jones for example. Despite having one of the best clean sheet records in the Premier League, most fans would not consider Jones to be a success.</p>

<p>No, if success is subjective then it&rsquo;s an internal matter and hopefully this is the last time I&rsquo;ll ever need to write about it again.</p>
