				<p>As a grow a little older views I once held collapse like a stack of cards under the gentle prod of criticism. No longer do I think creativity solely occupies the arts; anyone can be creative no matter what (or even in what) they do. It&rsquo;s only apt that I&rsquo;ll use one example in this post from another domain.</p>

<p>For some time I&rsquo;ve held the view that removing creative variables from a creative problem actually <em>encourages</em> creativity. In programming, the simpler solution to a complex problem is usually the best one. Writing code with fewer abstractions in mind (and writing simple tests) can allow programmers to think more creatively.</p>

<p>When we impose constraints (in other words removing the luxury of choice), we&rsquo;re often required to &ldquo;think outside the box&rdquo;; we frame our thinking around these constraints. A first draft of this post included references to lots of other areas where one might exhibit creativity but I think the axiom needs no clarification: constraint breeds creativity. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>
