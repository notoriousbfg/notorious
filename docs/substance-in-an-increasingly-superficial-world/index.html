				<p>It&rsquo;s been several months since I left social media for good, though I decided to hang on to Twitter in the end, anticipating that I might need it for professional reasons (but LinkedIn rather ironically had to go.)</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t necessarily seen the quality of my real-life relationships improve as I suggested they might <a href="/a-network-less-world">in my post in February</a>, but I do have a clarity of mind I don&rsquo;t think would have been possible with it; I can&rsquo;t imagine being constantly reminded of coronavirus would have been enjoyable.</p>

<p>It took a while before I stopped framing my life through the lens of Instagram, imagining what the caption for the image I was going to post was going to be, instead of experiencing the moment itself. So I&rsquo;d certainly say that my ability to experience the present has improved: using my eyes to look at beautiful scenery not my camera; using my ears to hear live music not my microphone. Reading Alan Watts&rsquo; &ldquo;The Wisdom of Insecurity&rdquo; also helped me to realise this.</p>

<p>Something I&rsquo;ve come to appreciate in this time without social media is our need, as a society, to &ldquo;present&rdquo; everything we do. Even in a non-virtual sense, it&rsquo;s as though unless we overemphasise the things we&rsquo;re interested in, they&rsquo;re not important. It&rsquo;s not acceptable to merely say &ldquo;I went kayaking the other day and enjoyed it&rdquo;. I must declare my eternal love to the sport of kayaking or it&rsquo;s not of any interest to anyone. And it seems as though everyone needs to have some kind personal &ldquo;brand&rdquo; (and some sort of social &ldquo;proof&rdquo;.)</p>

<p>I think social media&rsquo;s probably responsible for this. Just as we package and present our lives in a certain way online, we feel the need to do so in real-life to make ourselves seem more interesting, because &ldquo;more likes in the virtual world translate to more popularity in the real world&rdquo;. My generation was the first to grow up with social media so it&rsquo;s interesting to see all these biases finally emerge from our subconsciouses.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more important is how I think we define our own personal value. If we&rsquo;re to remove others from the equation, do our interests make us happy because of the way they make us feel?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all that really matters.</p>
