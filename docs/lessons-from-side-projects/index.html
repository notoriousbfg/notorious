				<p>A recent article I read forced me to think about the way I utilise my spare time to work on &lsquo;side projects&rsquo; and the lessons I&rsquo;ve learned from (many) failed attempts.
The Problem</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://jacksimpson.co/finishing-being-productive-busy/">recent article</a>, Australian PhD student Jack Simpson writes &lsquo;Even if you dedicate many hours to a task and it’s 80% of the way there, if you never finish then no-one will care&rsquo;. He&rsquo;s right of course - however brutally honest his words are.</p>

<p>The piece really struck a chord with me because so often I find myself starting new projects that don&rsquo;t go anywhere. Zuckerberg initially didn&rsquo;t dream of building Facebook, he created a way to connect with his classmates. I can always say I learned a great deal, but if I don&rsquo;t have anything to show people I can&rsquo;t say I ever did anything. I lose interest, or it dawns on me that I&rsquo;m building something that already exists, or I&rsquo;ve found a solution to a problem that doesn&rsquo;t exist - whatever. There has to be that middle step between the grand vision and the smaller tasks like writing lines of code.</p>

<p>Failed project ideas of mine include: an API-driven CRM, a food ordering system for offices, a chat platform for learning how to code and a ticket-trading platform for students. I have hundreds of entries in OneNote titled <a href="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">&lsquo;What&rsquo;s missing?&rsquo;</a> where I&rsquo;d look at the past week and come up with solutions to the problems I&rsquo;d encountered. Often these are problems only I&rsquo;d come across and the scope of the problem was too narrow; Often the problems were of a scope far too broad to ever be solved by a single solution.
The Solution</p>

<p>Looking back as I write this article, these aren&rsquo;t inherently bad ideas - some of the pieces are there, some aren&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m bad at coming up with ideas or identifying which ones will work or not; the crux of the problem is actually attempting to do too much with the time I have.</p>

<p>The last couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve been working on things that I can build an MVP of in a weekend. I wrote Tweet Thread in a day and I have a few things on the go right now. I&rsquo;m still interested in solving problems and doing cool shit with technology, but projects should be iterative.</p>
