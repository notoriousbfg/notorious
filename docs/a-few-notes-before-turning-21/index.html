				<p>When I began this article about a week ago I started to write about self-doubt and the toxic, intractable effect it&rsquo;s had on my life. In doing so, it morphed into a piece about self evaluation and personal growth.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>In the last 6 months I&rsquo;ve learned a great deal about when my personal judgements are wide of, or on the mark and this largely informs whether my opinion of myself is accurate or not. I&rsquo;ve found it&rsquo;s incredibly useful to be able to take a step back and assess how well you&rsquo;re doing, both personally and professionally and take action on areas that need improvement.</p>

<p>With my 21st birthday tomorrow, marking almost a year of continuous professional development, I wanted to write a few notes about some things I&rsquo;ve been thinking about for a while. While much of this may not be new to you, I encourage you to carefully reconsider these points and take as much meaning from them as you can.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Criticism doesn&rsquo;t have to be negative.</p></li>

<li><p>There&rsquo;s huge value in having the ability to spot your weaknesses and learn from them.</p></li>

<li><p>There&rsquo;s no ego in self evaluation.</p></li>

<li><p>A failure is always a learning experience. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25880738">Don&rsquo;t worry about getting things wrong.</a> You won&rsquo;t do it again.</p></li>

<li><p>Don&rsquo;t overanalyse. When I had mental health issues, I had a problematic tendency to overanalyse and criticise myself. In hindsight, the only impact this had was that my reduced self confidence caused me to have more of a reason to do this.</p></li>

<li><p>A team is only as strong as its weakest member.</p></li>

<li><p>You can&rsquo;t win an argument.</p></li>

<li><p>If you&rsquo;re wrong, admit it.</p></li>
</ol>
