				<p>I haven&rsquo;t published anything for a while because my mind has been in other places creatively and intellectually, but ultimately life just gets in the way. As my driving instructor says &ldquo;Life is unfair, Tim. Entropy prevails.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I first took up photography as a teenager because I thought it was easy, or had the appearance of something that was easy. My early explorations were with a compact digital camera so I didn&rsquo;t have to wait for the result, but I pushed my Dad&rsquo;s compact camera to its limits. I took photographs of everything including, much later, people. In fact I wrote to Alec Soth as a teenager asking for his advice on photographing strangers and he very kindly sent back some of his zines telling me, &ldquo;<strong>TODO</strong>&rdquo;. As I grew to become really quite technically proficient with photography, I knew there was a gulf between what I could produce and the work of some of the other young photographers I admired at the time (Olivia Bee comes to mind.) I knew that in order to create photographs that truly resonated with other people, I needed to photograph people and to connect with my subjects. There&rsquo;s a stunning photograph of a young couple in Vanessa Winship&rsquo;s &ldquo;She Dances on Jackson&rdquo; forever imprinted on my brain; their expressions tell us so much. To connect with your subject matter requires a considerable amount of time (and enough money to get by) neither of which I had at the time. I wanted to be a photographer but knew my father wouldn&rsquo;t let me; I instead took a stab at becoming a camera man for TV and failed.</p>

<p>In his Masterclass the poet Billy Collins says &ldquo;What you have to do in your poetry is tell a little white lie&hellip; that you love poetry more than you love yourself&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I think most people, to spend any considerable time doing something, must believe they&rsquo;re good at it. It&rsquo;s rare to slog away at something for years thinking you&rsquo;re bad at it. But then again, many creative processes are inherently fun. I&rsquo;m not the best painter but I enjoy applying paint to canvas, mixing colours and textures.</p>

<p>I think programming is the opposite. Most people who don&rsquo;t write code perceive it to be some incredibly complex skill but most of us with a couple of years experience know there are simple patterns. I used to work with a guy who insisted on using a green and black terminal theme (it was probably just defauly iTerm) because non-technical coworkers would walk past his desk and jokingly say things like &ldquo;are you in the Matrix?&rdquo; even though I knew he was just doing trivial git stuff. Funnily enough, thinking programming was &ldquo;what smart people do&rdquo; is one of the reasons I took it up in the first place; I had watched &ldquo;The Internship&rdquo; with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaugn and decided I was going to learn how to code and work at Google. Oh to be young and naïve. I&rsquo;ve met lots of stupid people who code but most are unsurprisingly pretty clever.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a view in literature that the story dictates the form of the novel; it&rsquo;s important to choose a viewpoint that suits the subject matter best. But so many first-time novelists choose to write in the first person because their own perspective is the only one they know; editors and literary agents see their work as self-indulgent. In photography, the book &ldquo;TTP&rdquo; by Hayahisa Tomiyasu comes to mind: its style and design (its form) is informed by the nature of its photographs and subject matter.</p>
