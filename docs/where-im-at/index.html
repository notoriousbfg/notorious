				<p><em>This post on the surface appears to be meandering because it brings together what probably seem like disparate ideas at first; but bear with me.</em></p>

<p>Much of my thinking at the moment is framed by relativism. I find it very difficult to see absolutes in a world that&rsquo;s so constantly in flux, where truth and opinion regularly flow in and out of one another. The position of the frame is very important: close up, things we observe can appear true - an apple falls from a tree. Take a thousand steps back and everything, whether it be the language I&rsquo;m using to communicate with you now, or gravity, can only be seen through the frame of human understanding; In fact everything in our <em>known</em> universe can be framed like this. Is this a contradiction in itself?</p>

<p>We use truths or absolutes for convenience, to communicate, because describing everything in a relative sense would be very slow and inefficient. So we attribute words to objects and experiences for convenience because we can&rsquo;t communicate telepathically. It might be useless to think about truth in this way, in the same way it&rsquo;s not pertinent to think about what came before time (or at least our perception of it). If you&rsquo;ll forgive the slight digression, Hawking said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Since events before the Big Bang have no observational consequences, one may as well cut them out of the theory, and say that time began at the Big Bang. Events before the Big Bang, are simply not defined, because there&rsquo;s no way one could measure what happened at them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is Time a human construct, or would it exist if humans didn&rsquo;t? Or is time merely perceived? Are we born with a sense of time or do we learn it?</p>

<p>The most popular criticism of relativism is that &ldquo;There cannot be absolutes&rdquo; is itself an absolute statement. Some things must be true or at least in a relativistic sense we must <em>consider</em> them to be true if we&rsquo;re to move forward. It&rsquo;s hard to even find a clear-cut definition of truth online:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&rdquo;&hellip;that which is true or in accordance with fact or reality&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But we know from the war in Ukraine that reality can be distorted, and there seems to be a lot of abuse of truth going round lately. I read comments online that say something like &ldquo;Objectively speaking, Putin is depraved&rdquo; - clearly an opinion.</p>

<p>Is everything then perceptual? In our minds? There are 7 billions humans on this planet all thinking and doing different things at the same time. How does one capture collective conscience? How do we agree on anything? How do we get anything done together if nothing is true?</p>
