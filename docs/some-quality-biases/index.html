				<p>It&rsquo;s so often that topics like &ldquo;why film X is better than film Y&rdquo; come up in conversations with friends. &ldquo;Better&rdquo; is an assessment of quality, something I&rsquo;ve been thinking about ever since reading Robert Pirsig&rsquo;s &ldquo;Zen and the Art of Motorcyle Maintenance&rdquo; a few years ago.</p>

<p>According to Pirsig, quality is a &ldquo;perceptual experience preceding intellectual thought&rdquo;. If one&rsquo;s to believe this, there can be no universal measure for quality; It must be an internal matter.</p>

<p>We often don&rsquo;t consider our own personal biases when deciding whether something&rsquo;s good or not (good meaning &ldquo;high in quality&rdquo;), but in this post I&rsquo;ll describe some common ones I&rsquo;ve encountered.</p>

<h3>Complexity</h3>

<p>When something has been created in a complex way we often assume it&rsquo;s because a great deal of thought has gone into its creation. This is especially true in programming where complex code can appear quite impressive. However it&rsquo;s usually the simplest code that is the highest quality; that has been refactored.</p>

<h3>Content</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s perfectly possible to dislike the themes discussed in a novel but still consider it to be well written. Conversely, it&rsquo;s possible to like the content and think the writing poor. However this is usually not the case: more often we think of things we like as being well executed and things we don&rsquo;t like as being bad. The same can be said of most of the arts.</p>

<p>It would be negligent of me to make no mention of &ldquo;The Last of Us: Part 2&rdquo;, which I wrote about here when I played it first. I&rsquo;ve since played it several times and still do not believe that the story choices (as sad as they may be) do not make this game &ldquo;bad&rdquo;. Our feelings about a story make our perceptions about the quality of writing biased.</p>

<h3>Popularity</h3>

<p>To see that other people liked or disliked something usually influences how we feel about it. In &ldquo;How Art Can Be Good&rdquo;, Paul Graham says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And yet the Mona Lisa is a small, dark painting. If you found
people who&rsquo;d never seen an image of it and sent them to a museum
in which it was hanging among other paintings with a tag labelling
it as a portrait by an unknown fifteenth century artist, most would
walk by without giving it a second look.</p>
