				<p>I&rsquo;d be lying if I didn&rsquo;t say founding, or at least working for, a SaaS startup was a long term aspiration of mine.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently in the &lsquo;learn everything I possibly can&rsquo; part of my career. I spend a great deal of time reading about not only startups but other things that interest me, like conservation, technology, business, journalism and current affairs, often in the belief that I&rsquo;ll be forced to question the world around me, and therefore identify problems to which I can invent effective solutions.</p>

<p>A large part of web development is identifying these problems, and designing apps and websites to best solve them. I guess that&rsquo;s why so many developers work on side projects: because they&rsquo;re an opportunity tackle real problems [1]. It&rsquo;s no secret that some of the world&rsquo;s largest technology companies (Google, Facebook, Microsoft) began as &lsquo;side projects&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, so many side projects I see online operate under the guise of &lsquo;research&rsquo; and while they may be impressive from a technical point of view, have few real-world applications. I personally struggle to find meaningful projects to work on, ones that might actually make an impact on somebody, somewhere.</p>

<p>It often seems like a struggle. You commit your time to something, only to realise you&rsquo;ve been looking in entirely the wrong place, or that the idea that seemed so original actually already exists. Paul Graham&rsquo;s essay &lsquo;How to Get Startup Ideas&rsquo; explains how often the ideas that are most successful are the ones that occur &lsquo;organically&rsquo; [2], where a founder identifies an opportunity out of an experience of their own. The best approach to coming up with project ideas therefore is to &lsquo;not &ldquo;think up&rdquo; but &ldquo;notice&rdquo;&rsquo;, in other words, put oneself in a situation in which they&rsquo;re more likely to identify real world problems.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5234692">A thread on Hacker News</a> highlights a general consensus that is, if you want to come up with lots of ideas, read a lot. Immerse yourself in subject areas that you might not have thought would interest you. Personally, I try to read at least 4-5 articles a day on any number of things. In print, I&rsquo;m an avid subscriber to National Geographic, but I sometimes dip into New Scientist, and of course I always read the weekend papers, which so often turn out to be waffle. Online, HN often points me towards articles I like to read. I frequent the Verge, Wired and New York Times websites for technology updates, and I can sometimes rely on my cultivated Twitter feed to send me in interesting directions.</p>

<p>Of course many of the opportunities that I do identify will lose traction, and I make a note of those and put them in a draw for a rainy day. I came across a site online, similar to an idea I had 6 months or so ago, that was a sort of food recommendation engine. My project had conservation in mind, but this one was built more around baking. I guess in a sense I dodged a bullet [3], but it&rsquo;s interesting to see someone have a similar idea and run with it. Often I look back on ideas from as recent as weeks ago, and as writers do, ask myself, &lsquo;How could I ever have thought that was a good idea?&rsquo;</p>

<p>I think therefore, to come up with meaningful side project and startup ideas, it&rsquo;s so important to question, &lsquo;Does anyone really want this?&rsquo;, and these ideas must come from actual problems people face. Do they have to be world-changing to be meaningful? Perhaps not, but the best startups are, and came from side projects that may not have seemed like they were.</p>

<p>[1] And learn in the process.</p>

<p>[2] &ldquo;At YC we call ideas that grow naturally out of the founders&rsquo; own experiences &lsquo;organic&rsquo; startup ideas. The most successful startups almost all begin this way.&rdquo; - Paul Graham, &lsquo;How to Get Startup Ideas&rsquo;.</p>
