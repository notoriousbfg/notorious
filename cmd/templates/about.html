        <p>Hi there! My name's Tim White and I'm a Software Engineer from Bournemouth, UK. You've somehow come across my blog, probably because you searched for me (naughty) or because you found one of my essays on Hacker News.</p>
        <p>For the uninitiated, I mostly use this blog to write about technology (and my position within it) but I also often write about quality and experience (and other things I'm interested in). Some of my favourite posts include: <a href="/building-software-sharing-knowledge/">"Building Software, Sharing Knowledge"</a>, <a href="/code-and-context/">"Code and Context"</a> and <a href="/some-quality-biases/">"Some Quality Biases"</a>.</p>
        <p>I blog for various reasons, including to educate others about things I've learned, to clarify my own thoughts and to read around subjects I'm interested in.</p>
        <p><a href="/feed/">timstagram</a> is where I share some of my life outtakes and experiment a little.</p>
